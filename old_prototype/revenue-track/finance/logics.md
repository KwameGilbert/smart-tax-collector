1. One‑Time Assignment + Automatic Due Calculation
   Assign once
   Finance adds a business–tax link in business_taxes with:

start_date (when obligations begin)

frequency defined on the parent tax_types (daily/weekly/monthly/etc.)

Optional end_date (if it ever expires)

On‑the‑fly “amount due”
Whenever you render the Finance or Client dashboard, the system:

Calculates how many “periods” have elapsed since start_date (e.g. 5 months)

Looks up how many periods have already been paid in payments (e.g. 2 months)

Due = (elapsed_periods – paid_periods) × tax_type.amount

No manual re‑assignment
As long as that one row in business_taxes stays active, the user will always see “You owe X periods” whenever their next due date arrives.

And with this would it be possible to show a part where they see the dates they paid and when they have not paid since? Like say they can see January paid, February paid and say current month is May they'll see the months they have not paid?

Yes, absolutely — with the schema you’re using, it’s very possible (and efficient) to display a clear payment timeline showing:

Months they’ve paid (e.g., January, February)

Months they’ve missed or not paid yet (e.g., March, April, May)

Here’s how it would work:

1. Know the Tax Frequency
From the tax_type.frequency field (e.g., “monthly”), you’ll determine the expected payment intervals.

2. Track Start Date
Each business_tax assignment has a start_date, which tells when the tax obligation began.

3. Generate Expected Intervals
Using PHP (or SQL), generate all expected payment periods from start_date up to the current date, based on frequency:

For “monthly”: January, February, ..., May 2025

For “quarterly”: Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, etc.

4. Check What’s Paid
From the payments table, retrieve:

payment_date

tax_type_id

business_id

Now match paid intervals against expected intervals to show:

✅ Paid: January 2025, February 2025
❌ Unpaid: March 2025, April 2025, May 2025

5. Show It in the UI
Display this as a clear timeline in the business/client dashboard or for collectors:

Green badge for paid months

Red badge or alert for unpaid months

This gives transparency and helps everyone stay on track without manual checks.
